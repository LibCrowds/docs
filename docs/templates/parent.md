Parent-child relationships between templates can be configured via this
section.

This option is useful for creating chains of projects where the tasks that
need to be created for one project rely on the results of another. For
example, you might want to create two project types, one to mark up the
titles in a set of images and another to transcribe them. In this case, the
marking up project would be the parent and the transcription project would be
the child.
