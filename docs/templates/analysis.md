As each task is completed an analysis process is run that compares all
contributions for that task and, based on the outcome, either sets a final
result or sends the task back for an additional contribution.

Before the contributions are compared a set of normalisation rules can be
applied. This rules can be configured via this section.

For more details of how the results analysis process works, see the
[Results Analysis](/analysis.md) section.
