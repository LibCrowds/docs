The redundancy settings for all tasks created from a template can be configured
via this section. These settings determine when a task is considered complete.

Result analysis will first be triggered once the minimum number of
contributions have been made. If the task type determines that a number of
contributions must match, before a final result is created, then contributions
will continue to be collected until that minimum number of matches is
established, or the maximum number of contributions is reached.
