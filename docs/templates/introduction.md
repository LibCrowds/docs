Templates contain all of the configuration details used to generate projects.
This includes a project description, the task details, a tutorial for
volunteers and rules about results analysis.

## Who can create templates?

Templates can be created by all registered users (unless this option has
been specifically disabled by administrators).

However, as configuring the template is probably the most complex stage of
creating up a set of projects, all changes have to be approved by a LibCrowds
administrator. Users are free to submit those changes, via the settings
described in this section of the documentation, but the changes will only
be pushed out once approved.
