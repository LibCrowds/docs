All task-related data produced by, or stored on the LibCrowds platform is
made publically via an API and for direct download in CSV and JSON formats.

The structure of each dataset varies according to its purpose. For example,
the task datasets contain information required to configure each task, whereas
contribution datasets contain the information submitted as answers to those
tasks. In the majority of cases, the final result data is likely to be the
most useful. This is the data produced once a task has been completed and
all contributions analysed. In their raw form, final results are stored as Web
Annotatations wrapped with information about the tasks that produced them. A
range of API endpoints are provided to further transform these datasets. For
instance, the final results data can be retrived as Annotation Lists that
can be consumed by IIIF compatible image viewers.

This section provides details about the structure of the final results data
and explains how it can be consumed.
