Task-related data can be downloaded via the Data page of each collection
microsite. Downloads are available in JSON and CSV formats, collated by
project, volume and collection. These datasets contain varying levels of
detail, as described below.

Note that everything contained in these datasets is also available via an
API. Depending on the objective, the API may provide a more suitable method
of access. The downloadable datasets are provided primarily for offline access
and for those more comfortable with flat file formats such as CSV.
