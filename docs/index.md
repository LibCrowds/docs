# LibCrowds Documentation

[LibCrowds](https://www.libcrowds.com) is a platform for hosting experimental
crowdsourcing projects from the [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/).

The application comprises a set of core webpages, including a homepage and an
administration interface. Sitting beneath these, microsites that encapsulate
related projects can be configured, each with their own set of themed pages.
