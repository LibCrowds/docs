The final output from Z39.50 projects is a list of MARC control numbers agaist
some other reference (e.g. a shelfmark). Each project also gives an option to
add comments, which can be used to flag up issues where chosen records don't
match exactly. For more details see the
[Creating Z39.50 Projects](/creating_projects/z3950.md) guide.

So, the final results for Z39.50 tasks are stored alongside three keys:

1. control_number
2. reference
3. comments

The values that are associated with these keys are determined first by an
automated process, then, if further checking is required, by a manual human
intervention process.

## Automated analysis

### 1. Check if all answers are empty.

This means that no users were able to find a suitable match and no comments
were given. If this is the case, an empty value is stored against each answer
key and the analysis process ends.

#### Example result

```json
{
  "info": {
    "control_number": "",
    "reference": "",
    "comments": ""
  },
  "last_version": true
  ...
}
```

### 2. Check for any comments

As a comment will often signify that a result requires further checking, any
tasks where commens were given are filtered out. If a comment is found then the
result `last_version` flag is set to `false` and the process ends.

```json
{
  "info": {
    "control_number": "",
    "reference": "",
    "comments": "Some comment"
  },
  "last_version": false
  ...
}
```

### 3. Check if the required match rate is met

If all answers were not empty, we check if a specified percentage
of all answers match. That is, the `control_number`, `reference` and `comments`
are exactly the same.

By default the required match rate is 60%. This equates to, for example, at
least 2 out of 3, or 3 out of 5 answers being exactly the same. If the required
match rate is met we store that matching answer as the final result and the
analysis process ends.

#### Example result

```json
{
  "info": {
    "control_number": "ocm00012345",
    "reference": "123.abc.4",
    "comments": ""
  },
  "last_version": true
  ...
}
```

### 4. Mark the result for further checking

If there are non-empty answers and the required match rate was not met then
we mark the result for further checking by setting the `last_version` flag to
`false`.

#### Example result

```json
{
  "info": {
    "control_number": "",
    "reference": "",
    "comments": ""
  },
  "last_version": false
  ...
}
```
