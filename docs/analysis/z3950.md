Z39.50

For more information on how Z39.50 projects are generated, see

Z39.50 contributions are stored with three main fields:

1. `control_number`:
2. `reference`:
3. `comments`:

Results for Z39.50 projects are analysed as follows:

### 1. Check if all answers are empty.

This means that no users were able to find suitable matches and no comments
were given. If this is the case, an empty value is stored against each answer
key and the analprocessysis ends.

#### Example result

```json
{
  "control_number": "",
  "reference": "",
  "comments": ""
}
```

### 2. Check if the required match rate is met

If all answers were not empty (see above), we check if a specified percentage
of all answers match. That is, the `control_number`, `reference` and `comments`
are exactly the same.

By default the required match rate is 60%, which equates to, for example, at
least 2 out of 3 or 3 out of 5 answers.

If the required match rate is met we store that matching answer as the final
result and the process ends.

#### Example result

```json
{
  "control_number": "ocm00012345",
  "reference": "123.abc.4",
  "comments": ""
}
```
