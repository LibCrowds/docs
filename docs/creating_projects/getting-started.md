LibCrowds projects can be generated by registered users with administrator or
editor rights. This section explains how to generate and publish a new project
for a collection microsite.

Projects are generated from templates that are maintained by LibCrowds
administrators. This is partly for quality control and partly so that it's
easier for future projects to be generated.

While the templates are highly configurable, we keep most of these
configuration options hidden at this stage. However, you can submit a request
to create or update the available templates. Once approved, templates can be
used to generate any number of projects for a collection microsite. See the
[Templates](/creating_projects/templates.md) guide for details.

During project generation you will also be asked to choose a volume from which
the input for the project is taken (the images, for example). The list of
volumes is also maintained by administrators for the reasons outlined above.
See the [Volumes](/creating_projects/volumes.md) guide for details of how
to request a new volume, or set of volumes.

To find out how to generate a new project, see the
[New Projects](/creating_projects/new.md) guide.
