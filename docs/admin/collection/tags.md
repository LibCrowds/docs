# Tags

Tags are used to help users more easily location the types of project that
they're interested in. The available tags for all projects within a collection
are managed via this section.

For each tag type created a new filter will be added to
the  collection's main projects page page (shown on the left in the screenshot
below).

## Creating

To add a new tag click the 'Add a tag type' button at the top of the page. In
the modal that appears enter a name for the tag type (e.g. Location), choose a
colour and set an initial list of tags (e.g. London, Plymouth etc.), then
click 'OK'.
