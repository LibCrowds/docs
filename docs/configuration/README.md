# Configuration

This section describes how to configure an instance of LibCrowds. It comes in
two main parts, both of which must be completed for the application to run:

- [Configuring PYBOSSA](/configuration/pybossa.md)
- [Configuring LibCrowds](/configuration/libcrowds.md)

## Plugins

You will also need to install and configure the following PYBOSSA plugins
(see the documentation for each):

- [pybossa-Z3950](https://github.com/alexandermendes/pybossa-z3950)
