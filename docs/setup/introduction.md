LibCrowds is fundamentally a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) Server-Side Rendered
UI, where the backend comprises various custom plugins, an instance of
[PYBOSSA](https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa) and a server that complies with
the [Web Annotation Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/).

Therefore, to get up and running we need to install, configure and run an
instance of LibCrowds, an instance of PYBOSSA, some PYBOSSA plugins and a
Web Annotation server. The following pages will take you through everything
you need to get a up and running locally, or to deploy to a production server.
