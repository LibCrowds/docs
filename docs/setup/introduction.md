LibCrowds is fundamentally a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) Server-Side Rendered
(SSR) UI that incorporates various custom plugins and communicates with a
[PYBOSSA](https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa) backend. Therefore, to get
up and running we need to install, configure and run an instance of LibCrowds,
an instance of PYBOSSA and some PYBOSSA plugins.

!!! info "Requirements"

    - PYBOSSA >= v2.9.0
