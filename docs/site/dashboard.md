## Updating

Statistics are updated every 24 hours, but if you want to see the most recent
data you can click the 'Refresh' button.

An alert will be displayed at the top of the page if there are any results
that have remained unanalysed for over a day. This usually indicates that
there is some issue with the automated results analysis procedure that should
be investigated further.
