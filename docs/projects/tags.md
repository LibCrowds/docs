# Tags

Tags are used to help users more easily location the types of project within a
collection that they're interested in. You can choose one tag for each tag type.
Contact an administrator if you need a tag that is not available.

After choosing your tags and clicking 'Update' they will be added to project
cards, tables and sorting options.
