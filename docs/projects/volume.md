The volume associated with a project will be set during project creation.
However, on the rare occasion that it is necessary, the volume can subsequently
be changed via this section.

Updating a project's volume is risky, as it will affect the way in which the
project's data is generated. Therefore, this page is restricted to users with
administrator rights and should be used with caution.
