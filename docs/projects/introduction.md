A LibCrowds project encapsulates a set of similar tasks. For example,
transcribing the the dates shown on a set of images. Each project is published
on a single collection microsite. This section contains guides the explain
how to create and configure projects.

Projects can be created or configured by all registered users. Administrators
can edit all projects, whereas all other users can only edit the projects that
they have created, or those where the owner has explicitly given them co-owner
rights.

To find out how to create a project see the
[New Project](/projects/new.md) guide.
