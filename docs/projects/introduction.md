A LibCrowds project encapsulates a set of similar tasks. For example,
transcribing all of the dates shown on a set of images. This section contains
guides that explain how to create and configure projects.

## Who can create projects?

Projects can be created by all registered users. The final publication
of all projects is subject to approval by LibCrowds administrators. Users can
edit their own projects, or any where the owner has explicitly given them
co-owner rights, whereas LibCrowds administrators retain the rights to edit
all projects.

By allowing all users to create projects, those particularly interested in
identifying specific information not already being captured by the platform
can setup projects to enable this. For example, a project could be designed to
capture all of the ticket prices shown in a particular volume of digitised
playbills. The resulting datasets will be made available for download via the
platform.

## How are projects created?

Projects are generated from templates that contain information used to
configure the task and determine how the results are analysed.

Creating these templates is probably the most complex stage of the process.
However, once created, a template can be used to more easily generate multiple
projects of the same type. To follow on with the example above, a template
designed to capture information about ticket prices could be reused to generate
many projects, for a selection of volumes, without having to configure the task
every time.

Once approved, templates are available for use by all registered users.

## How are volumes defined?

Volumes provide the initial input for projects. For example, a volume could
contain a link to a Flickr album or to a IIIF manifest.

The volumes available for each collection microsite are maintained by
LibCrowds administrators.
