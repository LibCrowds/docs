A LibCrowds project encapsulates a set of similar tasks. For example,
transcribing the the dates shown on a set of images. Each project is published
on a single collection microsite. This section contains guides the explain
how to create and configure projects.

Projects can be created or configured by registered users with administrator
or editor rights. Administrators can edit all projects, whereas editors can
only edit the projects that they have created, or those where the owner has
explicitly given them editing rights.

??? question "How do I request administrator or editor rights?"

    To request administrator or editor rights please get in touch by clicking
    the email icon in the footer of each page.

To find out how to create a project see the
[New Project](/projects/new.md) guide.
