New projects are generated from a chosen volume and template via this section.

Project templates provide all of the configuration details for a particular
task. For example, a template might be created to transcribe all of the titles
shown in an image.

Volumes provide the input source for a project (e.g. the images). The available
volumes for each collection are maintained by LibCrowds administrators.
One project can be built for each combination of template and volume.
Only the available volumes for the selected template will be shown.

## Creating a project

To create a new project, sign into your LibCrowds account and select
**New Projects** from the main menu.

Each project is associated with a single collection, so the first stage is to
choose a collection by locating it in the list and clicking **Select**.

You will be taken to a form with two dropdown options, **Template** and
**Volume**. Select a template, which will load all available volumes for that
template, then select a volume.

Once the selections have been made, click **Create**.

!!! tip "Adding filters"

    Once the project is created you will be taken to the project filters page
    where you select filters to make the project easier to find.

## Unavailable volumes

If a volume for a particular template is unavailable it is probably for one
of the following reasons:

1. It hasn't yet been loaded into the collection.
2. The template needs to be built from a parent project, which is not yet
complete.
3. A project has already been built for that combination of template and
volume.

For further guidance, you can always contact an administrator by clicking the
email link at the bottom of the page.
