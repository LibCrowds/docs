Projects are generated from templates that are maintained by LibCrowds
administrators. This is partly for quality control and partly so that it's
easier for future projects to be generated and organised. Similarly, you will
be asked to choose the volume that contains the input for the project
(e.g. the images). These volumes are also maintained by LibCrowds
administrators.

If you can't find a suitable template or volume for the type of project that
you would like to create please get in touch by clicking the email icon in
the page footer. We can then help you to locate the items you're after, or
design the required templates.

## Creating a project

The instructions on-screen will guide you through the creation process. In
short, the steps are as follows:

1. Choose a colleciton microsite
2. Choose a template
3. Choose a volume
4. Confirm

When the **Create** button is clicked the project will be generated. If the
project is to contain a large amount of tasks you will recieve an email when
the process is complete.
