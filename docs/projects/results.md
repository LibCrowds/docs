The results page lists all of the raw results data that has been
generated for a project. It can be used to monitor the outcome of the
automated [results analysis](/analysis.md) process, or to trigger
analysis for particular sets of tasks.

## Updating Results

To update a single result, locate it in the table and click **Analyse**.

To update all results for a project click the **Analyse All** button. This may
be necessary in the unlikely event that the network failed when the result was
first generated and before it was analysed, or if the platform's required
plugins were not set up correctly.
