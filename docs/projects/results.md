The results admin page lists all of the raw results data that has been
generated for a project. It can be used to monitor the outcome of the
automated [results analysis](/analysis/introduction.md) process or trigger
analysis for particular sets of tasks.

??? question "How do I open this page?"

    Administrator or editor rights are required to access this page. If you
    have the correct rights:

## Updating Results

To update a single result locate it in the table and click **Analyse**.

To update all empty results for a project click the **Analyse Empty** button
at the top right of the page. This may be necessary in the unlikely event that
the network failed when the result was first generated, or the platform's
required plugins were not set up correctly.

To update all results for a project click the **Analyse All** button.

!!! warning
    The **Analyse All** function should be used with extreme caution as it will
    overwrite all current results for a project with a fresh analysis. In
    general, it should never be necessary to use it but it is included here
    for cases where the analysis procedure has changed and the results have
    not been modified manually since their creation.
