## Updating the filters

A single value can be entered for each filter.

As you type, values already being used by projects for that filter will
be shown. It is preferable to choose existing filters where possible, but
if no valid option is available you can type the value you need into the box
and click on the entered value in the dropdown box.

To save the changes, click **Update**.

If you need a filter type that is not currently available please contact an
administrator (you can use the email link at the bottom of the page).
