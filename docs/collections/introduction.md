A LibCrowds collection contains a set of similar projects and each has it's
own set of themed pages that we call a collection microsite. Microsites are
configurable via the Librowds interface. This includes options to change the
page content, name, description, tagline, logo, task presenter, data
reuse license, tags, project templates and more. This section explains how
to create and configure a collection microsite.

Collection microsites can be created and configured by registered users with
administrator rights.

??? question "How do I request administrator or editor rights?"

    To request administrator or editor rights please get in touch by clicking
    the email icon in the footer of each page.

To get started with creating a collection microsite see the
[New Collection](/collections/new.md) guide.
