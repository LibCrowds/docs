A LibCrowds collection is a set of similar projects. Each collection is given
it's own set of themed pages that we call a collection microsite.

## Who can create collections?

Collections can be created and configured by users with administrator
rights.

## How are collection microsites configured?

Collection microsites are configured via a series of forms, available to all
LibCrowds administrators. These forms include options to change the page
content, name, description, tagline, logo, task presenter, data reuse license,
tags, project templates and more. This section of the documentation contains
details of all available settings.

[New Collection](/collections/new.md) guide.
