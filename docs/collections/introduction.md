A LibCrowds collection contains a set of similar projects. Each collection has
it's own set of themed pages that we call a collection microsite. These
microsites are configurable via the Librowds interface, which includes
options to change the page content, name, description, tagline, logo, task
presenter, data reuse license, tags, project templates and more. This
section explains how to create and configure a collection microsite.

Collection microsites can be created and configured by users with administrator
rights.
