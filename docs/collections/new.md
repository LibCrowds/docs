## Creating a collection

Collections are initially created with just a name and description. Once
created, you will be given access to all of the other configuration options,
which can be set before publication.

To create a new collection enter a name and description and click **Create**.

See the [Collection Details](/collections/details.md) guide to find out how to
update some of the microsite's core settings.
