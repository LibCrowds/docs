A set of markdown editors are provided here for modifying content for the About,
Projects and Data pages. Changes are made in real-time, although you may have
to refresh your browser to see them.

??? question "How do I open this page?"

    Admin rights are required to access this page. If you have admin rights:

    1. Sign in to your LibCrowds account.
    2. Click your username at the right of the naviation bar.
    3. Select **Collection Admin** from the dropdown menu.
    4. Locate the collection in the table and click **Open**.
    5. Select **Content** from dashboard menu on the left-hand side.

For the About page, navigation items will be generated from each level two
header, created in Markdown by using the ## tag, for example:

```
## Contact

This is the contact details section.
```

These navigation items can be clicked to scroll the users window to the top
of that section.
