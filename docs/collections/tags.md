Tags are used to help users more easily location the types of project that
they're interested in. The available tag types for all projects within a
collection are managed via this section.

The values assigned to each tag type are managed on a per-project basis,
either when creating a [New Project](/projects/new.md), or via the
[Project Tags](/projects/tags.md) settings page. For example, if the *Location*
tag type was added to a collection a project within that collection could then
assign the value *London*.
