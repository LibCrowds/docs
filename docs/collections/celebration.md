for that project, animated confetti will fall and a celebration message will
be displayed.

## Updating

Edit the Markdown fields to customise the celebration messages. There are two
types of message:

- **User completion:** Displayed when a user has completed all available tasks
  but the project still requires more contributions.
- **Project completion:** Displayed when a project is 100% complete. Note that
  this does not necessarily mean that the user has contributed to the project.
  The message will also be displayed if a user later attempts to access the URL
  of a completed project.

You can also choose the type of confetti that you want to fall.

## Testing

To test out the messages you can click the 'Test user' and 'Test project'
buttons at the top right of the dashboard page.
