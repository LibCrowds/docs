Via this page, a set of chosen projects can be featured on the homepage of
each collection microsite.

If no featured projects are selected, the top three most recently created
projects will be featured by default. This approach may cause a lack of
variety in the projects that appear on the homepage but does mean that the
list of selected projects doesn't have to be constantly updated.
