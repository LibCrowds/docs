LibCrowds integrates with the forum software, [Flarum](https://flarum.org/),
by enabling links to a particular forum topic from the main navigation
bar of each collection microsite. We also pull in a summary of recent forum
posts and add it to the collection microsite's homepage, hopefully making
the site seem more alive and encouraging participation.
