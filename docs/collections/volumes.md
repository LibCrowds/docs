Each volume is tracked as a name against a URI that will later provide the
resources for a project, or multiple projects. Keeping a list of all volumes
that will be used to generate the projects for a collection microsite helps
with later project generation and the aggregation of results.

## Updating the list of volumes

The list of volumes can be updated in bulk, via CSV. To open the CSV upload
form, click the **Upload CSV** button at the top of the page.

The CSV upload form will expain which columns are required in the CSV file.
For example, IIIF Annotation projects take an IIIF manifest URI as their input,
so the CSV file uploaded for these projects should contain a name in the first
column and a manifest URI in the second.

When you're ready, select your CSV file and click **Submit**.
