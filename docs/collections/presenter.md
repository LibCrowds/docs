## Selecting a task presenter

Before a collection microsite is published it is essential to select a
task presenter from the options in the **Task presenter** dropdown. Once
projects have been created for the microsite it will not be possible to
change this, as doing to would risk breaking the project within the microsite.
Once you have chosen the task presenter, click **Update** to save your
choice.

## Updating the note button text

A button that enables volunteers to add general notes about each task is
included in all task presenters. The text for this button can be configured
by editing the **Note button** input field, then clicking **Update**.

## Updating the submit button text

All task presenters contain a button to submit a task and move to the next. The
text for this button can be configured by editing the **Submit button** input
field, then clicking **Update**.

## Updating the share modal text

Task presenters contain a button that volunteers can click to show a share
modal. This modal will contain a link to a shareable version of the content
presented for the task (e.g. the image). The text that appears in this share
modal, above the shareable URL, can be modified by editing the
**Share text** Markdown field, then clicking **Update**.
