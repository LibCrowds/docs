## Updating the confetti type

You can choose the shape of the confetti that you want to fall by selecting
an option from the **Confetti type** dropdown and clicking **Update**.

## Updating the user completion celebration

This is displayed when a user has completed all available tasks but the
project still requires more contributions.

Edit the **User Completion** Markdown field and click **Update**.

## Updating the project completion celebration

This is displayed when a project is 100% complete.

Note that this does not necessarily mean that the user has contributed to the
project. The message will also be displayed if a user later attempts to access
the URL of a completed project.

Edit the **Project Completion** Markdown field and click **Update**.
