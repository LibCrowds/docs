Tags are used to help users more easily location the types of project that
they're interested in. The available tag types for all projects within a
collection are managed via this section.

The values assigned to each tag type are managed on a per-project basis,
either when creating a [New Project](/projects/new), or via the
[Project Filters](/projects/filters) settings page. For example, if the
*Location* tag type was added to a collection a project within that collection
could then assign the value *London*.
