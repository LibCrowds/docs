# Volumes

Volumes are used to group projects within a collection and the volume that a
project belongs to will usually be set at project creation. However, if it is
later decided that a project's volume should be changed this can be done by
locating it in the table and clicking 'Select'.

The available volumes for a collection can be
[set by administrators](/admin/collection/volumes.md).
